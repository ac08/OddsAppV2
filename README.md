## Description

- (NFL) Odds App is a minimal, lightweight live scores and odds application built on the web. It utilizes several web-based technologies and the SportsData.io API (for NFL) to track Scheduled, InProgress, and Completed odds and scores for the NFL Season 2020.

- Concept: A lightweight and clean (NFL) sports odds and live score web application.

- Process: Refactored (MLB) Odds App to include handle-bar template technology to render game elements. Technologies used, include: jQuery, Handle-Bars, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap as well as the SportsData.io API for NFL scores and odds.

Disclaimer: SportsData.io Free NFL Trial allows access to almost their entire live scores and odds database. However, as a Free Trial, the odds and scores are not accurate, but the outcomes depicted are accurate. For example, in real life, Team A is leading Team B 24-10, the web application here may actually show Team A leading Team B 10-5.
